3D Thermodynamics Simulator


A 3D heat conduction simulation that visualizes temperature changes over time using Matplotlib and NumPy. The animation updates dynamically, and each frame is saved as a PNG image.


Features
✅ Simulates heat diffusion in a 3D grid.


✅ Uses finite difference methods for calculations.


✅ 3D visualization with Matplotlib.


✅ Saves PNG frames of the simulation.


Installation
1. Clone the Repository


```bash


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thermodynamics-simulator.git
cd thermodynamics-simulator


```


2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
For Mac/Linux:


```bash


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


```
For Windows:


```bash


python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate


```
3. Install Dependencies


```bash


pip install numpy matplotlib


```


Usage
Run the simulation:


```bash
python heat_simulation.py


```


After running, the frames will be saved in the frames/ directory.


Dependencies:




```bash


Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
```
